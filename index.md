## RELEVANT PROJECTS AND EXPERIENCES

* BoxAndArrow:
  * My Masters Project: Exploring the Use of Software Visualization in Computer Science Education and Developing a System to Facilitate the Construction of Algorithm Visualizations with JSAV and WebAssembly
  * An open source prototype application that works with WebAssembly and the JavaScript Algorithm Visualization library, allowing students to write C++ programs that map to a data structure visualization that is viewable on a personal computer through a web browser.
  * This project provides starter code and instructions for implementing arrays, linked lists, and binary trees. As a learning tool, it includes error-checking features to help students identify mistakes in their code and makes it easy to test programs with various inputs and commands.
  * Web application built with WebAssembly, C++, JavaScript, the JavaScript Algorithm Visualization Library (JSAV), and Flask.

* ParkCore:
  * ParkCore is a parking solution that connects local homeowners near Chico State with students, faculty, and staff through the rental of driveways as personal parking spaces.
  * Mobile application built in Flutter, for Android and iOS.

* Repo Generation Tool:
  * A cross-platform (web, Android) application for students to generate a private GitHub or GitLab repo in a course organization or group.
  * The app works with the the GitHub API and GitLab API
  * Built with Flutter and Go

* Cluster Web Portal:
  * A web application for students to add, remove, and keep track of SSH keys associated with their account.
  * Built with Django, Foundation, CSS, HTML, and a SQLite database.

* Hello Plants!:
  * A garden journal app that makes it easy to keep track of the plants in your garden.
  * Provides one spot to document when seedlings or seeds were put in the ground, how the plants have grown over time, and any problems encountered, as well as keep track of the amount harvested over the season.
  * The app allows users to take photos of their plants, and then see the growth of their plants on a timeline and how the garden performed over the season.

  * Comparing the performance of WebAssembly (Wasm), written in Rust, with the performance of JavaScript (JS) for running computationally intensive functions in a browser.
  * Included a review of the literature on Wasm, JS, and Web-based performance, and a research paper and presentation from my experience.

* ClassroomWhoIs (in progress):
  * Developing an app to help teachers and students learn each other’s names.
  * Initially created for Intro to Web Programming (CINS110) in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
  * Redeveloped as a web app for Web Programming Fundamentals (CINS 465) in Django and Vue.js, adding a user login system and a real-time chat system, with Foundation for responsive design.
